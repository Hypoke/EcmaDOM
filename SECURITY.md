# Security Policy

Thank you for taking the time to investigate the security of EcmaDOM. We appreciate investigative work into system security. If you discover a vulnerability, no matter how small, we would like to know about it to address it with appropriate measures as quickly as possible. This document outlines the method we use to work with the security research community to address runtime security.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please open a new Security advisory with your findings. We strive to resolve all issues as quickly as possible and are more than happy to play an active role in the publication of write-ups after the problem is resolved.

Try to include as much information as possible in the initial report so we can quickly address the issue.

**Please do not open security issues in the public issue tracker.**

We will be able to resolve it as quickly as possible. Usually, a list of steps to follow and the vulnerable EcmaDOM version is enough. More complex vulnerabilities may require further explanation.

## Our Commitment to You

- We will not take legal action against you regarding your report.
- We will handle your report with strict confidentiality and will not pass on your personal details to third parties without your permission.

Thank you for helping us keep EcmaDOM secure!
